### Final Product Submitted
- Images does not showcase reviews left by user nor rating, but it indeed does show once the user posts their review/rating.
- Things I'd like to improve if I rework on this project:
  - Fix the review page design, as it's a bit clunky and should look more modern/sleek to match the rest of the application.
  - Add onto the account/setting page such as a profile with bio info.
